## Sirius Web Application

- Run ./sirius-web-deps.sh
- In web-sirius.py, change IP addresses/ports for each application.
    - These applications should be already be running using ../start-APP-server.sh
- Currently, the speech recording is a python script so the web-application
  needs to run locally with a microphone to run this functionality
