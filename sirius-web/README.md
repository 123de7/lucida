## Sirius Web Application

- Run ./sirius-web-deps.sh
- In web-sirius.py, change IP addresses/ports for each application. These
  applications should be running using using ../start-APP-server.sh
- Currently, the recording function is a locally called python script so the
  web-application needs to run on the same machine with a microphone to run
  this functionality
