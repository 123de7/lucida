3) Compile client:
make

4) Start server:
./start-qa-server-thrift.sh

3) Errors when starting the server:
a) Problem as of 06/07/15
	-Error message: 
	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: info/ephyra/util/Dictionary
	...

	-Solution:
	If you haven't already, run:
	tar xvf question-answer.tar.gz

	Then:
	cd question-answer/
	ln -s ../openephyra-thrift // creates symbolic link
	cd ~sirius/sirius-application/question-answer/openephyra-thrift
	./start-qa-server-thrift.sh

b) Problem as of 06/07/15
	-Error message:
	org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused	

	-Solution:
	The QA service automatically tries to register with the command center
	at the port specified in start-qa-server-thrift.sh.
	If the command center is not running, then the registration fails,
	and this message is reported.
	To solve this problem, first start the command center server
	located at ~/sirius/sirius-application/command-center
